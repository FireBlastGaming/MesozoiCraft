# The license for you mod. This is mandatory metadata and allows for easier comprehension of your redistributive properties.
# Review your options at https://choosealicense.com/. All rights reserved is the default copyright stance, and is thus the default here.

# Display Test controls the display for your mod in the server connection screen
# MATCH_VERSION means that your mod will cause a red X if the versions on client and server differ. This is the default behaviour and should be what you choose if you have server and client elements to your mod.
# IGNORE_SERVER_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the server but not on the client. This is what you should use if you're a server only mod.
# IGNORE_ALL_VERSION means that your mod will not cause a red X if it's present on the client or the server. This is a special case and should only be used if your mod has no server component.
# NONE means that no display test is set on your mod. You need to do this yourself, see IExtensionPoint.DisplayTest for more information. You can define any scheme you wish with this value.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: this is NOT an instruction as to which environments (CLIENT or DEDICATED SERVER) your mod loads on. Your mod should load (and maybe do nothing!) whereever it finds itself.
#displayTest="MATCH_VERSION" # MATCH_VERSION is the default if nothing is specified (#optional)

# The description text for the mod (multi line!) (#mandatory)

Hello, Welcome to MesozoiCraft. This is a mod based entirely on the Mesozoic Area (The era of Dinosaurs). There are three main eras:
Triassic
Jurassic
Cretacious

Each era has its own respected organisms, such as the creatures that used to roam that era and the greenary that flourished at that time and much much more!
This mod is very customizable, by the configs:
    You can select which era you want to access (As many as you would like.):
        This would in turn make it unable to access the plants/mobs/items from that era. These items would however still be in the creative menu. They just wouldn't spawn naturally/in chests.
    There will also be a tick in the config to select whether you would like the entities to spawn naturally or not.
        This would result in the choice to play the mod in two different ways:
            The first being "surviving the eras, with the creatures and plants spawning naturally."
            The second being "reviving the dinosaurs like Jurassic Park/World."

I would like to add, everything in this mod is portrayed in a realistic fashion. So the items and processes to acquire the fossilized creatures will include steps that corrolate to how it would be done in real life, (OBVIOUSLY WITH THE LIMITS OF MINECRAFT)
(AND OBVIOUSLY REVIVING EXTINCT CREATURES HASN'T BEEN DONE IRL SO THAT WILL FICTIONAL BUT AS REALISTIC AS POSSIBLE)

Apart from all this I hope you enjoy my mod and please drop any feedback in my Discord Server plus if you need any SUPPORT please feel free to contact us on Discord:

You may DM me, but don't ping. I will make sure to read it as soon as I am free!
HAVE FUN!
